# Coursework Management System

A comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline group coursework management for university students. This application addresses common challenges in academic collaboration by consolidating communication, task management, and file sharing into a single, integrated solution.

## Overview
Managing group coursework often involves juggling multiple platforms—WhatsApp for communication, OneDrive for files, separate calendars for meetings, and informal methods for tracking contributions. Our platform eliminates this fragmentation by providing an **all-in-one solution** tailored specifically for student coursework projects.

## The Problem We're Solving
Based on extensive user research with **15 interviews and a focus group**, we identified three critical pain points:

1.  **Platform Fragmentation:** Students use 3-5 different applications per project, leading to cognitive overhead and missed communications.
2.  **Lack of Accountability:** Verbal task assignments without written records result in unclear responsibilities and unequal contributions.
3.  **Meeting Coordination:** Finding common availability across team members wastes significant time at the start of every project.

## Target Users
University students working on group coursework projects across all disciplines, with an initial focus on those with Microsoft/Office 365 university accounts.
